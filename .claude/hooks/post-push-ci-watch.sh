# PostToolUse hook (Bash): after a successful `git push` to this repo's
# github.com/victorrentea/* remote, tell Claude to start a BACKGROUND watch of
# the resulting CI run so it can report pass/fail when the run finishes.
#
# A hook can only return context synchronously — it cannot call back later when
# CI completes. So instead of watching here, it instructs the agent to launch
# `gh run watch --exit-status` as a background Bash task; the harness re-invokes
# the agent with the result when that task exits.
#
# The Bash command is parsed into a real shell AST by the `pushwatch` Go helper
# (mvdan.cc/sh) rather than regex/shlex — so quoting, `cd` chains, and
# `git -C <dir>` are interpreted correctly. The helper reports whether the
# command is an actual `git push` and the working directory it runs in.
